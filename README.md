# AVASTA - ANDROID VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT and SECURITY TESTINGÂ AID
Android app vulnerability scanner

## avasta.py
This python script serves as an automated vulnerability assessment and security testing tool for Android applications. It systematically decompiles APK files, analyzes the resultant Smali code. It searches for predefined patterns that indicate security weaknesses, presenting a detailed report of the identified vulnerabilities and recommended mitigation strategies. . Its systematic approach aims to provide a comprehensive overview of potential security weaknesses within the decompiled codebase, facilitating a more informed understanding of an application's security posture.
